It was a visual scripting based coding tool, and I spent a long time just trying out new ways to make my small little web games better. In 2022, I took the AP Computer Science Principles Course at my High School, and I instantly fell in love all over again. I fine-tuned my AP app and tried to put as much features as I could into it. As of 2023, I have been learning JavaScript, Java, React, Swift, as well as C#. And I have been enjoying my time learning all of these.",

I would test new ideas and new concepts and ways to make my small web games just a little bit more fun. Throughout this course, I learned how to develop and polish my own video games myself, and I loved every second of it. ",

But, I also grew quite an interest in how to create edited videos. In 2017, I picked up Hitfilm 4 Express, a lesser known video editing software. I would continue to build up my skills in my field, and even picked up Premiere Pro when I was a freshman in High School. I joined my school's TV program as well after taking Video Production. I grew to greatly enjoy making polished videos, and in this time picking up After Effects and sharpening my Premiere Pro skills. I would even go with my TV Team to the Student Television Network Convention in March, a competition. Our school's TV team, which I was a part of the Graphics Team, placed 3rd!",
